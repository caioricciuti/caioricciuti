# Hey! My name is Caio Ricciuti ðŸ‘‹
## About me
Iâ€™m a Junior programmer with some experience in web development. I love open source and I do my best to contribute!

## Current working on:

     I made this app because in my journey to become a programmer I found very hard to finish and track simple tasks as "add .git ignore file", and more than once I didn't know what I've done and
     what I supposed to do. It would be easy to use some Issue tracker, but that's not funny right!

## My Next Step(s)

Be able to:
* Build a [Django](https://djangoproject.com/) JSON API
* Create a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) web front-end
